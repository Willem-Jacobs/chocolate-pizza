### Reflections

- Heather: This took us exactly 3 hours because Ryan would not let us have any more! I lucked out and got Will as my partner. I think we work well together and once we figured out our branching, can collaborate well!

- Will: Needed more time. Great working with Heather. We both need more experience with CSS!
